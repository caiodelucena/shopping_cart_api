# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

en:
  hello: "Hello world"
  carts:
    errors:
      cart_not_found: "Cart not found"
      product_not_found: "Product not found"
      product_already_in_cart: "Product already exists in cart. Use POST /cart/add_item to update quantity"
      product_not_found_in_cart: "Product not found in cart"
      quantity_must_be_positive: "Quantity must be greater than zero"
    messages:
      cart_removed_empty: "Cart removed because it became empty"
